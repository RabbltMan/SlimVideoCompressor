## ðŸ““ Introduction

Slim Video Compressor is an application designed to simplify the process of compressing video files for easier sharing in instant messaging apps, social media, or any other platform where file size can be a limitation. With Slim Video Compressor, you can quickly reduce the size of your original videos without opening up any RAM-consuming video editors or struggling with codes or commands.

## ðŸ§© Dependencies
